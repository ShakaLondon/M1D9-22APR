        BINGO CHALLENGE!!!
        Create programmatically (with JS) a BINGO board with 76 cells, from 1 to 76.
        Create a button to randomize a number from 1 to 76. The same number should be highlighted on the bingo board

        EXTRA: 
        - Take ALWAYS a new number (eg. avoid randoming the number 10 3 times)
        - Create a USER BOARD with 24 randomized numbers that highlights as the main board does
        - Let the user choose HOW MANY user boards he's willing to play with and create them.
